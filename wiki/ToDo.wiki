= Introduction =

Here is the roadmap for future versions.


= Details =

By subject:
  * *Image processing*
    * Create a better dataset with different films (negatives and positives), resolution and scanner devices. Help needed !
        For the moment : mostly slide scans from Epson 4990
    * Improve for negatives and B&W films


  * *User interface*
    * Build under Windows
    * Adapt size of display for larger screens than current size of GUI
    * Backup copy of original as an option


  * *Packaging*
    * Follow Qt instructions to make a MacOS X deployment package including library dependencies
        http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/deployment-mac.html 
    * Try to use Iceberg for packaging for Mac users


  * *Interoperability*
    * Interfacing with Adobe Lightroom (OK for file name as argument under Linux: works fine with _gqview_ for example).
    * Any interest for Gimp interaction ?
